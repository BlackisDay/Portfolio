        <p>Hello! Welcome to the beginning of my portfolio. My name is Victor D. Hernandez. This portfolio may not be much, but throughout the months I will be making it more responsive and
            updating it that way it seems better and shows my skills. As of right now this is what i can do with just CSS and HTML alone. Later on I will be showing work with JavaScript. Eventually,
        I will be combining all three to show the progress of my adventure in the bootcamp. As of right now, I am 23 years old and I have a couple of stuff that I am very interested in. One of those
    stuff is this anime called One Piece. As of right now it has over 1070 episodes and I am caught up with it all. I've seen every single one of its' movies. Well below I will be showing more
  stuff about me. </p>
